2023-05-18,Introduced in Senate,118,1728,Senate,S,Dark Web Interdiction Act of 2023,S,2023-12-20T15:15:20Z,https://api.congress.gov/v3/bill/118/s/1728?format=json,Senate,S,2023-12-20T15:09:22Z," <p><b>Dark Web Interdiction Act of 2023</b></p> <p>This bill establishes enhanced criminal penalties for distributing controlled substances via the dark web. It also establishes other programs and requirements to address the use of the dark web for illicit drug activities. (<i>Dark web</i> means the portions of the internet with hidden sites and services that (1) are not generally searchable, and (2) can only be accessed with specialized devices or services that conceal the identities and locations of users.)</p> <p>Specifically, the bill provides an enhanced criminal penalty for delivering, distributing, or dispensing controlled substances via the dark web. </p> <p>The bill also provides statutory authority for the Joint Criminal Opioid and Darknet Enforcement Task Force, which supports the investigation and prosecution of drug offenses committed via the dark web domestically and internationally. In addition, the Department of Justice must report on how and to what extent virtual currencies are used for opioid distribution via the dark web.</p>",2023-12-20T15:15:20Z,00
2023-05-17,Introduced in House,118,3398,House,H,Safe Access to Cash Act of 2023,HR,2023-12-20T15:15:20Z,https://api.congress.gov/v3/bill/118/hr/3398?format=json,House,H,2023-12-20T15:03:11Z," <p><b>Safe Access to Cash Act of 2023</b></p> <p>This bill establishes a new federal statutory framework to govern robbery offenses involving ATMs and related conduct.</p> <p>Currently, the federal bank robbery statute makes it a federal crime to take or attempt to take by force and violence or by intimidation, money or other property from any bank, credit union, or savings and loan association. A violation is punishable by a statutory maximum prison term of 20 years (or 25 years, if the offense includes assault or use of a dangerous weapon).</p> <p>However, federal circuit courts have split on whether forcing someone to withdraw money from an ATM qualifies as an offense under the federal bank robbery statute. In United States v. Chavez, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held that the bank customer, rather than the bank, had possession of the funds when the robbery occurred, so a necessary element of the federal bank robbery statute--that the money belonged to the bank--was not satisfied. In contrast, the Tenth, Seventh, and Fourth Circuits have held that directly forcing a bank customer to withdraw money from an ATM constitutes a federal bank robbery because the funds belonged to the bank when the withdrawal occurred. </p> <p>This bill establishes new statutory criminal offenses for ATM robbery and related offenses such as ATM theft. A violation is subject to the same criminal penalties as an offense under the federal bank robbery statute--a statutory maximum prison term of 20 years (or 25 years, if the offense includes assault or use of a dangerous weapon). </p> <p><br> </p>",2023-12-20T15:15:20Z,00

(This type of transaction is often referred to as a default proceed transaction.)</p> <p>If a submitted background check remains incomplete after 10 business days, then the prospective purchaser may submit a petition for a final firearms eligibility determination. If an additional 10 days elapse without a final determination, then the federal firearms licensee may transfer the firearm to the prospective purchaser.</p> <p>The Government Accountability Office must report on the extent to which the changes have prevented firearms transfers to prohibited persons. </p> <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation must report on the number of petitions it receives for final federal firearms determinations.</p> <p>The Department of Justice, in consultation with the National Resource Center on Domestic Violence and Firearms, must report on further amendments to the background check process that would likely reduce the risk of death or great bodily harm to victims of domestic violence, domestic abuse, dating partner violence, sexual assault, and stalking.</p>",2023-12-20T15:00:22Z,00
