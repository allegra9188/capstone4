Welcome to our Capstone Project!

Together, we can democratize trading strategies with transparency for all.

Our intended user is someone who is curious about the financial markets, while wanting to ascertain the same strategies our countryâ€™s politicians use for their personal portfolios.

In 2022, out of the 131 members of congress that disclosed their trading reports, they on average beat the S&P 500 by an average of 17.3%; with the highest return being +51.6% (benzinga).

By creating a simplistic, user friendly version of trade watchers for amateur traders, or curious individuals. We hope to bridge the information gap elected officials have.

Enjoy!
